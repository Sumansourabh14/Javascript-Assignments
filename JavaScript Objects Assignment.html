//Make a few instances and print out the properties.
//Modify a few of the properties and print out the results again.

/*
4. Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and
lastName properties, but donâ€™t define a Person class first.
Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name.
It seems very odd to Java programmers to make an object without
first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers do this sort of
thing all the time.

  let person_obj = {
    firstName: "Karl",
    lastName: "Marx"
  };
  console.log(person_obj.firstName);
  console.log(person_obj.lastName);
  person_obj.lastName = "Angels";
  console.log(person_obj.lastName);

/*
5. Try reading the middleName property from your variable above.
Try assigning to the middleName property.
Try reading the property again after you assign to it.
Is this behavior a good thing or a bad thing?
*/
  console.log(person_obj.middleName);  //undefined
  person_obj.middleName = "Carlos";
  console.log(person_obj.middleName);  //output - Carlos
  console.log(person_obj);
  //output - {firstName: "Karl", lastName: "Angels", middleName: "Carlos"}
